Micropython | Board
0|D3~ Boot fails if pulled low (need to be careful what it's connected to)
2|D4~ (also Led1 but inverse)* Boot fails if pulled low (need to be careful what it's connected to)
4|D2~
5|D1~
9|SD2 (D9?)
10|SD3 (D10?)
12|D6~
13|D7~
14|D5~
15|D8~
16|D0 (also Led2 but inverse)*

~ after board pin means it can do PWM
D0 is actually the only one that can't...

On my ESP32 boards the pin number printed on the board is the same as the number used in micropython \o/
